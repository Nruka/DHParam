# DHParam
  This library allows you to create DHParam objects to store the theta, alpha, a, and d parameters for a joint. Parameters can then be accessed/modified or used in a simple function to generate the transformation matrix from the previous joint. It can be applied to an arbitrary number of DOF and an example is provided that uses 2.
